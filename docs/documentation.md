# DevOps Git Project Documentation

## Tasks Overview
1. Initialized Git repo and pushed to GitHub.
2. Created `main`, `dev`, and `feature` branches.
3. Used pull requests for merging.
4. Added README and .gitignore files.
5. Created version tags.
6. Documented all steps in Markdown.

## Branch Strategy
- **main** → stable production-ready code  
- **dev** → integration branch for new features  
- **feature/** → feature-specific development  

## Pull Request Workflow
1. Developer creates a feature branch.
2. Code changes are pushed and reviewed via PR.
3. Merged into `dev`, then to `main` after testing.
